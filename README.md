# Java Calculator Program

## Description

A modular Java-based Calculator program that performs basic arithmetic operations (addition, subtraction, multiplication, division), generates Fibonacci sequences, and calculates the sum and mean of arrays. The project is divided into three files for better organization:

- **Main.java**: Entry point for program execution.
- **UserInput.java**: Handles user input for numbers, arrays, and operation selection.
- **Calculator.java**: Implements the calculator logic and operations.

## Features

- Addition, Subtraction, Multiplication, and Division of two numbers.
- Fibonacci sequence generation for a specified number of terms.
- Sum and Mean calculation for user-defined arrays.
- User-friendly menu-driven interface with switch-case logic for operation selection.

## Requirements

- Java Development Kit (JDK) installed on your system.
- A text editor (e.g., Notepad++) or IDE (e.g., IntelliJ IDEA, Eclipse).
